# Some thoughtful coding questions I encountered while looking for a first coding position

## Why this company and why now?

As an aspiring web developer, I am trying to set myself up for success. This meant striving for a deeper and wider level of knowledge and practice surrounding  web technologies, and computer science. It also meant ensuring I write good code, can troubleshoot, and work in team coding environment. However, it also means finding the correct position. 

My approach in the workplace is to take complete ownership of the whatever task I am working on. It is something I learned about while worked in world-class biopharmaceutical facilities. A diligent operator must strive continuously toward perfection (as measured by effectiveness checks). Here I am comparing code to the SOPs which dictate the operators actions.  Like SOPs, this code must be written and re-written. The first step to attain a  working program or process. Then we can experiment - perhaps to find that established techniques must be subverted in favor of a new practice or technology. Everything I have read from your website leads me to believe you support this entrepreneurial spirit. I am also interested in consumer fintech and have experience in the tools you use. The answer to why now is simply that I have reached milestone in my learning journey, I have deep knowledge of a complete stack, knowledge of algorithms, and a complex capstone project built. 

## Imagine your ideal role. How would you define success in your work?

I have in my mind my ideal role. Success for me means doing my best. This is not a subjective or nebulous answer. But it has a lot in built-in assumptions. First among these is the assumption that I am truly doing my best. I know I am a coder because I possess a relentless drive and endless interest in these technical challenges. The second of these assumptions is that I am prioritizing my actions appropriately. This assumption in turn rests on one having ultimate respect for the project, team and position. 

Working as young, self-taught biochemistry researcher, I loved data and was frustrated sometimes by lack of progress. Whilst I could teach myself techniques and how to find holes in the current knowledge in the literature, I had not learnt that research is often non-linear. One does not go from question to answer. Many times he/she first must go all over the place - lost in a cloud.  In deeply challenging tasks, which I care a great deal about, and in which I would have liked to have succeeded 'yesterday', I have learned to keep this in mind. Thus success is not measured directly such as finishing the project. This would a dangerous approach for the already endlessly driven coder. 

## Tell us about a challenging technical problem you had to solve. It could be architectural, a persnickety bug, scaling issues, or anything else. What was challenging? What was your role? What tradeoffs were part of the solution? What did you learn?

The payment process of an e-commerce platform I built utilizes a webhook sent from paypal to the platform backend. The order should not be marked as paid until the payment is verified - a verification which cannot come from front-end alone. This use of a webhook has an inherent delay which results in 2 problems. First, another user could try to checkout with the same item. Because of the delay introduced by the webhook, inventory drawdown may not have occurred yet from the first order. The second customer could pay for the item and then we have sold an item which we have purported to have in stock, but which is actually out of stock. The second problem caused by a non-instantaneous webhook is that the user is not immediately shown the outcome of the payment. 

To solve the first problem, I simply send a notice to the backend whenever a payment is submitted to paypal. This notice pulls the inventory from stock. If the payment to which the notice is attached fails, then we can add the stock back to inventory. This approach could result in false drawdowns, but in the case of the this client, most of the orders are manufacturing requests for made-to-order items.  

My approach to second problem is somewhat compromised in the interest of saving time. I may in the future learn a way to subscribe to backend changes from the front end. That is, to have changes in the backend be revealed spontaneously to the frontend. Currently, once the paypal form is submitted, I show a timer on the screen to indicate processing. I also send a request once every few seconds to see if the webhook signal came through. Once it comes through the payment information is populated.
